This is a plugin that provides default Facebook Pixel functionality for Craft Commerce (CraftCMS). For a full list of events supported visit the [wiki](https://github.com/moment-inc/craft-fbpixel/wiki).

## Getting Started

1. Download and copy to plugins directory.
  * Make sure to name this plugin's folder `fbpixel/`
  * A quick command to do this from the root of your Craft project is `mkdir tmp && curl -L https://github.com/moment-inc/craft-fbpixel/archive/master.zip -o tmp/craft-fbpixel.zip && unzip tmp/craft-fbpixel.zip -d tmp/ && cp -r tmp/craft-fbpixel craft/plugins/fbpixel; rm -rf tmp/;`.
2. Enable the plugin via the admin interface
3. Add a your pixel id in the admin settings
4. Add `{% hook 'fbpixel.renderBase' %}` to your `_layout.twig`
5. Now your template will have all events that don't require additional setup.
